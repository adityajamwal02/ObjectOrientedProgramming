# Object Oriented Programming
#### It aims to implement real-world entities and bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Why do we need object-oriented programming
1) To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless. <br>
2) To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns.  <br>
3) We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming. <br>
4) It ensures code reusability. <br>
5) It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we donâ€™t have to write basic stuff over and over again. <br>

## OOPs Concepts:
### Class
A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. <br>

### Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.

### Data Abstraction 
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. 

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.

### Inheritance
The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes. So when we create a class, we do not need to write all the properties and functions again and again, as these can be inherited from another class that possesses it. Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.
