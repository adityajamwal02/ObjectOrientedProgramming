# Object Oriented Programming
#### It aims to implement real-world entities and bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

## Why do we need object-oriented programming
1) To make the development and maintenance of projects more effortless. <br>
2) To provide the feature of data hiding that is good for security concerns.  <br>
3) We can solve real-world problems if we are using object-oriented programming. <br>
4) It ensures code reusability. <br>
5) It lets us write generic code: which will work with a range of data, so we donâ€™t have to write basic stuff over and over again. <br>

## OOPs Concepts:
### Class
A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. <br>

### Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data.

### Data Abstraction 
Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. 

Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
Dynamic Binding
Message Passing
